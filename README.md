## Description

The chosen project is #3 “iPad Restaurant Application”. Chosen pattern is the builder pattern.

In our improvised burger restaurant there are only burgers and cold drinks available, 
but you may construct your own burger (different buns, sauces, cheese types etc.) or drink. 
Once you are done with creating your own type of burger, it may be sent to the kitchen for our chef to make it. 
If you are not sure what to choose, we have some presets for you to choose between.
